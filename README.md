## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Steam Integration

1. Obtain a Steam Web API key from [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
2. Open UnlockIt settings
3. Enter your Steam API key
4. Start adding games to your library

## üìñ Guide

### Supported Emulators

UnlockIt currently supports the following Steam emulators for achievement tracking:

- **ALI213** - Full support for achievement tracking and playtime monitoring
- **RUNE** - Compatible with most games and features
- **CODEX** - Works with achievement unlocking and progress tracking (dual location support)
- **ONLINE_FIX** - Supports online features and achievement synchronization
- **Steam Config** - Native Steam configuration file support
- **Goldberg SteamEmu** - üÜï Latest addition with JSON/INI format support

### Adding Games with Emulators

#### Method 1: Direct Game Addition

1. Launch UnlockIt
2. Click "Add Game" or use the "+" button
3. Navigate to your game's installation folder
4. Select the game executable
5. UnlockIt will automatically detect supported emulators

#### Method 2: Emulator Compatibility Fix

If your game doesn't appear or isn't working properly with UnlockIt:

**Step 1: Backup Original Files**

1. Navigate to your game's installation directory
2. Locate the `steam_api.dll` file
3. Rename it to `steam_api.dll.bak` (this creates a backup)

**Step 2: Use SteamAutoCracker Tool**

1. Download **SteamAutoCracker** from: [https://github.com/BigBoiCJ/SteamAutoCracker/releases/tag/2.2.1-gui](https://github.com/BigBoiCJ/SteamAutoCracker/releases/tag/2.2.1-gui)
2. Extract the downloaded archive to a convenient location
3. Run `SteamAutoCracker.exe` as administrator
4. In the application:
   - Browse and select your game's executable file
   - Choose **ALI213** as the crack type
   - Click "Crack" to apply the emulator files
5. The tool will automatically generate and place the necessary files:
   - `steam_api.dll`
   - `steam_api64.dll`
   - `valve.ini`

**Step 3: Test Game Launch**

1. Try launching your game
2. If the game launches successfully, you can now add it to UnlockIt
3. UnlockIt should now be able to track achievements and playtime

**Step 4: Rollback if Needed**
If the game fails to launch after applying the crack:

1. Delete the generated emulator files:
   - `steam_api.dll`
   - `steam_api64.dll`
   - `valve.ini`
2. Rename `steam_api.dll.bak` back to `steam_api.dll`
3. This means the game is not currently supported üò¢

### Troubleshooting

#### Game Not Detected

- Ensure you're pointing to the correct game executable

#### Achievements Not Tracking

- Make sure UnlockIt is running before launching the game
- Check that the game is added to your UnlockIt library

#### Game Won't Launch

- Follow the rollback steps above to restore original files
- Try running the game as administrator
- Check Windows Defender or antivirus settings (emulator files might be flagged)
- Ensure SteamAutoCracker was run as administrator

### Best Practices

1. **Always backup original files** before applying any emulator cracks
2. **Use SteamAutoCracker as administrator** for best results
3. **Test one game at a time** when applying emulator changes
4. **Keep UnlockIt running** while playing games for proper tracking
5. **Check compatibility** before purchasing üòÇ or installing new games
