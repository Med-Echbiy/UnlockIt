This document outlines the release process for UnlockIt using GitHub's release system.

## Branch Strategy

- **`main`** - Production-ready code, releases are tagged from here
- **`develop`** - Development branch for new features
- **`feature/*`** - Feature branches for specific development
- **`hotfix/*`** - Emergency fixes for production issues

## Release Types

### Major Release (v1.0.0 â†’ v2.0.0)

- Minor improvements

## Automated Release Process

### 1. Prepare Release

```bash
# Create a release branch
git checkout -b release/v1.1.0 develop

# Update version numbers
# - package.json
# - src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
# - src-tauri/Cargo.toml

# Create release notes
# .github/RELEASE_NOTES/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.1.0.md

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "chore: prepare release v1.1.0"

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.1.0
```

### 2. Create GitHub Release

```bash
# Tag the release
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Release v1.1.0"
git push origin v1.1.0
```

### 3. Automated Build

The GitHub Action will automatically:

- Build the Tauri application for Windows x64
- Create MSI installer
- Upload artifacts to the release
- Update the release with build artifacts

### 4. Manual Release (Alternative)

You can also trigger a release manually:

1. Go to GitHub Actions
2. Select "Release" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter the version tag (e.g., v1.1.0)
